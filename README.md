# Enterprise Context Mesh (ECM) 🌐
> **The Unified MCP Server Hub for Governed Agentic Workflows.**

Enterprise AI fails because agents cannot "see" into legacy data silos safely. **ECM** is a high-performance, standardized data-layer built on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. It acts as the "Central Nervous System" for autonomous agents, bridging the gap between LLMs and fragmented enterprise data (PostgreSQL, Salesforce, SAP).

### 🚀 The 2026 Competitive Edge
While others build simple chatbots, ECM enables **Zero-Copy Architectures**:
* **Secure Data Handshakes:** No data is moved; agents query source systems in-place via MCP.
* **Unified Tooling:** Standardizes 10+ legacy data sources into a single JSON-RPC interface.
* **Architecture-First:** Integrated directly with my [AI-Ops-Agent] and [Eval-Reliability-Platform].

### 🛠️ Core Tech Stack
* **Protocol:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) 1.0 (SSE & stdio)
* **Runtime:** Python 3.12+ (Asyncio-driven)
* **Connectivity:** SQLAlchemy, JSON-RPC 2.0, Secure Webhooks.
